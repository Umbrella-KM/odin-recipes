    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An omelette (sometimes omelet in American English, 
        see spelling differences) is a dish
        made from eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying
        pan. It is a common practice for an omelette 
        to include fillings such as chives, vege
        tables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese,
        onions or some combination of the above. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>3 large eggs.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons water.</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>One tablespoon butter, plus extra for glossing the omlette.</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped Gruyère, Cheddar, or any other flavorful melting cheese.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme or chives (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Whisk the Eggs: In a bowl, crack the 3 large eggs. Add 2 teaspoons of water, a pinch of salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Whisk until the mixture is well combined and slightly frothy.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Pan: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter and let it melt, swirling the pan to coat the bottom evenly.</li>
        <li>Add the Egg Mixture: Once the butter is bubbling but not browned, pour in the egg mixture. Let it cook undisturbed for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir Gently: Using a spatula, gently stir the eggs, pushing them from the edges toward the center. This helps cook the eggs evenly. Continue until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top.</li>
        <li>Add Cheese and Herbs: Sprinkle the ⅓ cup of shredded cheese evenly over one half of the omelette. If using, add the finely chopped thyme or chives.</li>
        <li>Fold the Omelette: Carefully fold the omelette in half over the cheese. Let it cook for another minute or so until the cheese is melted and the eggs are fully cooked but still soft.</li>
        <li>Plate the Omelette: Slide the omelette onto a plate. If desired, add a small pat of butter on top for extra gloss. </li>
        <li>Serve: Enjoy your omelette warm, seasoned with additional salt and pepper to taste! </li>
    </ol>
