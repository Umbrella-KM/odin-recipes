        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water (about 110째F or 43째C)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Your choice of toppings (e.g., pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, onions, spinach, etc.)</li>
        <li>Dried oregano and basil (for seasoning)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center, then add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness (thin crust or thick crust).</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a pizza stone.</li>            
        <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top, then add your desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle dried oregano and basil for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Slice it up and serve hot!</li>
